	      The Cytoplasm project is a revolutionary new approach to medical technology. It intends to bring much-needed modernisation to an increasingly antiquated healthcare system.

	      In the past, even for a routine checkup, patients with cardiovascular conditions were required to stay in hospital overnight, connected to bulky, ageing machines. But, with co-operation from ARM and the UCL Electronic Engineering department, we are creating a series of discrete, lightweight wearable sensors that will transmit data wirelessly to a centralised network. This network can be accessed by doctors from almost any device: such as a tablet, web browser or even a mobile phone - bringing unprecedented simplicity and innovation to treating cardiovascular conditions.  <br /> <br />
